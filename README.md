# Lumerical_FDTD_Scripting_Tools
A collection of scripts categorised by their use-case intended for use in the Lumerical FDTD solver in the Ansys optics suite. Some scripts are cross-compatible with MODE as well.

Handling of exported .mat data is done using my other package called [DMU](https://github.com/DeltaMod/DMU/tree/main/DMU)
Each example setup file contains annoted python code that goes over how we use the package to analyse our data.
